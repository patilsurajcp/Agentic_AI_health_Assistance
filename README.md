<h2>Proposed Solution<h2>
<pr><ol>
<li>System Architecture: How the AI system would be structured (e.g., front-end user interface, back-end AI engine, database integration).</li>
<li>Key Features: A detailed breakdown of the functionalities the checker would offer (e.g., symptom input, probable cause analysis, preventive advice, care recommendations, integration with telehealth).</li>
<li>Technology Stack: The specific technologies and tools that would be used (e.g., Python for AI, specific ML/NLP libraries, cloud platforms, database systems).</li>
<li>Data Sources and Integration: How verified medical data from sources like WHO, government health portals, and medical journals would be ingested and kept up-to-date.</li>
<li>User Experience (UX) Design: How the user interface would be intuitive and user-friendly.

<pr><h2>System approach<h2>
<ol><li>Set up the sandbox by creating the new project</li>
<li>Giving the storage for the Model</li>
<li>Associating the watsonx runtime server</li>
<li>Setup the agentic Ai build</li>
<li>Providing the instruction to the Agent</li>
<li>Selecting the model here the model selected is granite-3-3-8b-instruct</li>
<li>After the model selected tune the model parameters that is frequency, seeds, tokens</li>
<li>After the model is tested successfully create the new deployment space</li>
<li>After creating the deployment space deploy the model</li></ol>
